There are no changes to the P4 source code that is analyzed.  The main
point of this directory is to have checked-in example table dependency
graphs generated that are smaller, because they omit control flow
dependency edges, labels on edges, and the full text of conditions in
condition nodes.  This makes them less useful for details, but better
for printing out and examining.
